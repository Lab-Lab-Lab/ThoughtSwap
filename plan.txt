Plan for the week 3/24:

Goal: MVP
start with few apps, and then if it gets cosfusing, refactor it out
if i code soemthung bad, not it with an "issue" and then move forward

- Look at the models and create views. we have instances of everything 
via data migrations and will worry about how users etc are created through 
the interface later 

- 0003_seed_example: this is the example data that exists in the database 
that will be used in the views. This will later be fixed to be able to be
instaciated with an interfcae but for now the data will exist here
