When deleting a bad thought, should it be perma deleted or just not visible on screen?
    - What about an isDeleted field in the model set to false?

TODO:
- Display current prompt and all responses
- Add a delete button to the responses
- create a way to view old prompts
- be able to resend old prompts with new promptUse? (is the separate proptUses just for the  back end / researchers?)
- Groups...?
