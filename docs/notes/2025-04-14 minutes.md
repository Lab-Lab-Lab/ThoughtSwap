# Late Joiners
1. when someone joins late, what do we need to send them?

# Swapping
1. we assign even to those absent? even to those who don't submit? yes to both

# Action Items
1. when prof "swaps" it's not just an instantaneous thing. they students' views remain in a different state until next prompt or next session (no composition widget at this time, but still see prompt.)
    * as a student who has submitted 1+ thoughts to the current prompt, when prof swaps the thoughts, i still can see my authored thoughts but like collapsed 
    * SO ADD ACTIVE PROMPTUSE to SESSION
1. would be good to have a state diagram for at least the UX of teacher/student
2. to then know whether that prompt is accepting thoughts or have closed and is swapped and in discussion ad substates to the session state or change is_active on promptuse to be a state enum
