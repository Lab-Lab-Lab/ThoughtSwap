Plan for the week 3/24:

Goal: MVP
start with few apps, and then if it gets cosfusing, refactor it out
if i code soemthung bad, not it with an "issue" and then move forward

- Look at the models and create views. we have instances of everything 
via data migrations and will worry about how users etc are created through 
the interface later 

- 0003_seed_example: this is the example data that exists in the database 
that will be used in the views. This will later be fixed to be able to be
instaciated with an interfcae but for now the data will exist here

**




Questions:
- Best practice for creating a button?
- Why do users not have first_name and last_name?
- dashbaord vs teacher_dashbaord + (student_active_session vs teacher_active_session(Dont remember what this means)) 
- Session object is connected to a course. I think it should be the other way around becuase when I am trying to access
weather a course is active or not, it feels wroing to find the session object and not the course object.
        - Changed to a OneToOne from ManyToMany and did not switch the session and course objects around
- Best way to update a field in the db? 
    -  AJAX request?
- Cannot update the status of a session. Error message is in the terminal.
