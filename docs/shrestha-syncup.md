# Notes

1. in swapping make sure as many authorts are represented as possible
2. old prompts are available for reinstantiation
3. instructor can request old responses

# Priorities
1. prompt bank and prompt reuse
2. somehow the students indicate their thoguhts about the ditributed thought
3. start having semantic analysis
4. can the students do an activity on the thoughts and like each separately bin them into buckets? or like even multi-person grouping task
5. can there be a reflection form or somethign for the students to say what happened in the in-person discussion
